# Advent of Code 2022

Trying to complete each day in a different language or framework.

My strategy is to save the harder challenges for frameworks/languages I'm already familiar with.

I _tried_ doing this last year, but I lost interest about half way. Hopefully this year will be different.

## Progress

- [x] Day 1 - Clojure - [Calorie Counting](1-Clojure)
- [x] Day 2 - Perl    - [Rock Paper Scissors](2-Perl)
- [x] Day 3 - Lua     - [Rucksack Reorganization](3-Lua)
