## Final remarks on Clojure

My only other experience with Lisp languages was Scheme, which was my first real programming language I had learned when I was 13 (2016).

I enjoyed using Clojure, if there are potential job opportunities using Clojure (especially for web development) I would certainly pick it up. I enjoyed the pure, functional style. The macro-threading operators (`->` and `->>`) really cleaned up the code, definitely my favourite feature of this language.

The tools available in the Clojure ecosystem are a delight to use. The `clojure` homebrew packages includes a REPL environment and interpreter. There is an open-source performant LSP server available at https://clojure-lsp.io.
